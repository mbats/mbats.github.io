When I was a child one of my favorite game was [Puzzle Bobble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble), you may remember these two little dragons Bub and Bob. What I loved in this game : simple rules, easy to play and so very [addictive](http://www.gamesgames.com/game/puzzle-bobble).

This is exactly what I feel when I think about the new **[Properties View](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/properties/Properties_View_Description.html)** feature in [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/):

*   The rules are really **simple** as it is the same as the ones existing for the other Sirius representations : define your properties in the .odesign file, it is **dynamic**, no code generation is involved.

*   It is very **easy** to use as it follow habits of Sirius Specifier : use expression to go through the model, then it is **flexible** even for complex Ecore models.

*   And it is also greatly **addictive**! You will start by trying it on one of your Sirius based modeler and finally you will want to use it everywhere, even on non Sirius based editors.

During the summer we worked hard on this topic and today we are glad to announce Sirius 4.1\.
