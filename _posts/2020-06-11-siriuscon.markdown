_TLDR; On June 18th connect to @SiriusCon Live 2020 to watch a demo of the Obeo Cloud Platform._

<i>“Mamma mia, does it show again <br/>
My my, just how much I've missed you?“ <br/>

On the 18th of June, I will have the pleasure of presenting the Obeo Cloud Platform, with my co-speaker [Stéphane Bégaudeau](https://twitter.com/sbegaudeau), at [SiriusCon Live 2020](https://www.siriuscon.org/).

After such a long time, it is great to be able to connect with the [Eclipse Sirius](http://eclipse.org/sirius) community.

If you have to create a graphical modeling workbench for your own DSL, then you know how powerful Sirius is to help you design your own modeler based on EMF. In just a few hours, you get a modeling studio dedicated to your own domain.
The main issue faced by our customers arises when they need to distribute the bundle to their end users. A truly effective deployment is difficult to come by. Many struggle to either deploy or maintain their solution. And their team are feeling the pinch.

To solve these challenges, I am excited to demonstrate the Obeo Cloud Platform (OCP), the Cloud-based solution developed by Obeo for deploying modeling tools on the web. With OCP Modeler, modeling tools developed with Sirius can be installed on a Cloud server and are rendered in a web browser. Our purpose is to carry the spirit of Sirius.
What our users typically love in Sirius is:
the ability to define your modeling workbench in a configuration file,
no code generation involved as everything is interpreted at runtime,
flexible even for complex models.
So we kept all those principles and now allow you to easily define workbenches running in the cloud.
We rebuilt the Sirius runtime from the ground up, for the long haul.

I've been talking about it for a long time now! And we’re really proud to show that OCP is available and working today, so our talk will be purely a live demo: no slides (almost), no bullet points, not feature lists: just us, showing the capabilities of this modeling environment!

We will give you as well an overview of the context, the roadmap and how OCP Modeler positions with Sirius.

Referring to ABBA’s words, take a chance on OCP!

<i>“Honey I'm still free <br/>
Take a chance on me <br/>
Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see <br/>
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me“ <br/>
[Take a chance on me](https://youtu.be/-crgQGdpZR0) <br/></i>

During SiriusCon 2020, we will not only demonstrate OCP, but also make a big announcement about its future. So, attend SiriusCon and be in for a huge surprise!
In the meantime, as a preparation, [you can dance, you can djibe](https://youtu.be/xFrGuyw1V8s) (and no even if I am a big #ABBAFan I will not do my talk in a fancy glittering costume… neither Stéphane even if it could be very memorable :)).
