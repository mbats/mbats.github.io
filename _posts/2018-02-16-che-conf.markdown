A small post to announce that I will be speaking at [CheConf18](https://www.eclipse.org/che/checonf18/index.html), a one day conference dedicated to [Eclipse Che](https://eclipse.org/che/) an extensible cloud development platform. I am really excited to participate to this event! I will co speak with Stevan Le Meur, Che maintainer from RedHat about **Building Extensibility and Community for Che**. During our session, you’ll get a preview of the work we prototyped at [Obeo](https://www.obeo.fr/en) to bring the modeling stack to the web and what class of tools one can envision.

Perhaps you hadn’t hear about CheConf so far ? No problem: it’s not too late to participate. Indeed, there’s no need to negotiate with your boss, no need to book a flight and an hotel: this conference happens entirely online and is free!  

You just need to [subscribe](https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=7kv7dn9ab&p=oi&m=1127869207900&sit=dqf8xmplb&f=ab2389bc-9888-4ff7-978e-f922c1210d52) on the web site, and you'll be able to join the conference when you want.
Have a look at the great [schedule](https://www.eclipse.org/che/checonf18/sessions.html).
And do not forget our session **Wednesday February 21, 2018 17:30-18:00 Paris Time** or **wherever you are** in the world!

Stay tuned!
