And here it is! The [Sirius Web](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/sirius-web.html) _“Behind the scene”_ third session.
I am pleased to give the stage to Florian Barbin, Consultant at Obeo.
He gives a short tour of the new incremental layout he developed with William Piers based on Thales needs.
We are very grateful to our customers for contributing to Sirius Web!
