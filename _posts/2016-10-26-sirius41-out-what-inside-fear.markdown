Wednesday will be a huge day for [Obeo](https://www.obeo.fr/en/) at [EclipseCon Europe 2016](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016). You will find [several talks about Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/program/sessions/accepted?keys=sirius&field_experience_value=All&field_session_type_tid=All) in the program, and one thing for you, you have to attend our talk about [Sirius 4.1: Let Me Sirius That For You!](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/sirius-41-let-me-sirius-you)

As usual when I have to give a talk I am a little frightened but in fact I love this feeling which pushes me to do my best :)

Our slides are ready, our demo is exciting, now we just need you at Theater Stage - Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 16:00.
