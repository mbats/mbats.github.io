That’s too sad! [EclipseCon Europe](https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/) finished yesterday.

It was again a great conference, with inspiring talks and excellent discussions with different members of the Eclipse community. These moments with our community are motivating us to prepare the future of [Eclipse Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius).

So what’s next? What would we cook for you in Eclipse Oxygen?

As we already said in our talk, we are already preparing the future with Sirius 4.1 when we introduce the _DRepresentationDescriptor_. This internal change has no impact on normal users: it was made as a first step to **prepare for better scalability** down the road. For specifiers and developers who wrote code that depends on the internal organisation of the *.aird files, you may need to adapt your code.

To learn more about the Sirius roadmap, be sure to not missed Cedric’s talk at [SiriusCon](http://www.siriuscon.org/).

I will also give a talk with Stéphane specifically about the Properties view feature, we will detail what’s possible with this new feature:

*   Let Sirius automatically create default properties views for your designer

*   Create a simple properties view description and customize it as you do for other types of representations thanks to the following widgets: label, text, text area, checkbox, radio, list, reference

*   Use the new EMF.Edit customizations provided by Sirius

*   Discover the power of the dynamic mappings to automatically create the properties view fields for the different types of elements used in your metamodels

*   Understand how to provide filters and validation programmatically

*   Learn how to contribute some custom widgets

And much more!

Do not look for excuses, SiriusCon is where you have to be if you are interested in graphical modeling: easy to come as it will be held in Paris near the tour Eiffel, it’s a one day event, and it’s free. The [program](http://www.siriuscon.org/#program) promises to be interesting with talks about case studies on the morning, technical sessions by the afternoon and a clinic all the day.

I am counting on you [being there](http://www.siriuscon.org/register.php) on November 15th and I hope to see you soon at SiriusCon!
