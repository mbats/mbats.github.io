If you enjoyed our [previous](http://melb.enix.org/sirius/sirius-4-0-be-prepared-for-the-future/) post on [Eclipse Sirius](https://eclipse.org/sirius/) 4.0 new features, read on to hear the Sirius border song.

**Customizable border style**

The border style of your diagram elements can have a semantic meaning defined by your graphical notation: you may want to express a different information whether the border shape is dashed or plain. Here and now, with Sirius 3.1, it is possible to define such styles for both the nodes and the containers (like it was already possible for edges).

**Preferred side for border nodes**

By default, border nodes can be located on any side of its parent. It is now possible to restrict border nodes to specific sides only. Thus the end user will not have the possibility to create or to move a border node on a forbidden side. Authorized sides can be specified in the advanced tab of the border node style.
