On **Wednesday, October 21 at 2:00 p.m. CEST**, Obeo’s Spacecraft 42 will launch the SIRIUS-II mission from Code Launch Complex 42 (CLC-42) at Nantes Dev Force Station in France. SIRIUS-I mission previously launched [Sirius](https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/) to the Eclipse Foundation with Obeo’s & Thales astronauts on board back in 2013. The first mission was a success with the adoption of Sirius Desktop, based on the Eclipse platform, by a large community.

SIRIUS-II Mission aims to **release Sirius Web**, the Cloud-based evolution of Sirius, 100% Open Source. This mission is also in charge of **the launch of the [Obeo Cloud Platform](https://www.obeo.fr/en/products/obeo-cloud-platform) (OCP)**, the solution offered by Obeo for deploying modeling tools to the web.
With Sirius Web, modeling tools developed with Sirius can be installed on a web server and are rendered in a browser. Our goal is to carry the spirit of Sirius into a new technological space.
