_Disclaimer: First, you should know that I am a girl born in the 80’s and so I grew up watching (and watching and re-watching…) Disney’s movies, and I am still used to watch them when new ones are released. So I am sorry for you: no doubt, at the end of this article you will have many annoying songs running in your head. 
But all those girls made what I am today and it is only justice to them to ear once more time what they have to say ;)_

Seven years ago I joined the [Obeo](https://www.obeo.fr/) company. At that time, it was a small frenchies’ company making open source modeling tools. I was a free software activist but at that point even though I was using lots of free software, I never had the bravery to contribute by my own on my free time. When I was thinking about Obeo, I just wanted to be [part of that world](https://youtu.be/SXKlJuO07eM).

At some point as my technical skills could fit their needs, I decided to [let it go](https://youtu.be/L0MK7qz13bU) and send them my resume.

And know what? They recruited me! It was both amazing and scary. It was like a dazzling place, a [whole new world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kl4hJ4j48s) to discover.

Year after year, I got the chance to work and learn from the talented Obeo’s experts about Eclipse & modeling stuff. They shared their high technical skills & knowledge with me and I loved this atmosphere of constant research of improvements and innovations. I learned so much! 
Working at Obeo opened me the doors of the open source community through the Eclipse community. I had the opportunity to participate to many conferences, giving talks and sharing my knowledge in turn. I could not say [how far I would go](https://youtu.be/cPAbx5kgCJo) but I was on the open source community road…

[I’ve got a dream](https://youtu.be/wbVlGESh9Mc)... Be part of the open source world! Day after day it became true. First, two years ago I became committer on the Eclipse [Sirius](https://eclipse.org/sirius/) & [EEF](https://eclipse.org/eef/) projects, and this year, since one month, I am the [Eclipse Planning Council](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Planning_Council) chair.
I am really proud of working on free software and particularly on the Sirius technology. I feel even happier when this framework is used to create other impressive open source tools such as [Capella](https://www.polarsys.org/capella/), a graphical modeler for Model Based System Engineering.

A few months ago, Obeo’s management announced me that we will open a new subsidiary in Vancouver, Canada! This was an awesome news. Our current CEO [Stéphane Lacrampe](https://twitter.com/slacrampe) would move overseas to manage the new entity. This will allow us to be physically present on the new continent, making our international expansion easier and faster. [Cédric Brun](https://twitter.com/bruncedric) our CTO will replace Stéphane as CEO.
And they offered me to become the new Obeo’s CTO. I am at the same time proud and really excited by the many challenges this new position brings! I will do my best!

So being Obeo’s CTO is my new game from now. This means for me lots of fun ahead, this is my new spoonful of sugar! 

<i>“In every job that must be done <br/>
There is an element of fun <br/>
You find the fun and snap! <br/>
The job's a game <br/>
And every task you undertake <br/>
Becomes a piece of cake“ <br/>
Mary Poppins <br/></i>

Thanks open source community, Eclipse Foundation and Obeo for giving me this opportunity!
