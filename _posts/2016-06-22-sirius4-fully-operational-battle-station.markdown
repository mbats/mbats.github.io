[Finally](http://melb.enix.org/sirius/sirius-4-0-super-powered-api), with Sirius 4.0, some newly introduced components are declared fully operational. 

**Compartments**

The way your data is represented is better structured and the information is easier to understand. With Sirius 3.0, it was already possible to create compartments, but we had introduced it as an "experimental" feature since some behaviors were not supported yet. Today compartments are fully operational. [](http://orig06.deviantart.net/173c/f/2014/325/c/0/kangaskhan_by_weaponix-d877jc6.png)

Now the runtime strings are externalized and a dedicated mechanism exists for the odesign files.
