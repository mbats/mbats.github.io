<p>I work as a software developer at <a href="http://www.obeo.fr">Obeo</a>. In my daily work, I am mainly focused on the development of modeling tools with <a href="http://eclipse.org/sirius">Sirius</a> like <a href="http://umldesigner.org">UML Designer</a>. I am also committer for the <a href="http://eclipse.org/eef">EEF</a> and the <a href="http://eclipse.org/sirius">Sirius</a> projects. In my free time I am interested in Arduino stuff and contribute some Eclipse plugins for cross compilation like the <a href="https://github.com/mbats/eclipse-buildroot-bundle/wiki">Buildroot Eclipse plugin</a>. I am also a free software activist who has organized and participated in free software events in the Toulouse area.
