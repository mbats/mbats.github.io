Sirius web is a framework to easily create and deploy modeling studios to the web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sirius web is evolving a lot and we would like to share with the community these on-going enhancements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am pleased to introduce a new regular series of videos: &lt;em&gt;“Behind the scene of Sirius Web”&lt;/em&gt;.
The goal is to show you in 1-2 minutes each month what we are working on in the Sirius Web project.
For this first session, I invited Stéphane Begaudeau, Software Architect of Sirius Web to present his work on the Diagramming Component that aims at making this component easier to reuse in any web environment.&lt;/p&gt;

The Obeo Cloud Platform is built as an open-core product relying on the open source Eclipse Sirius project (EPL 2.0 licence) and more precisely on the Sirius Web component. As I explained in my previous post, Sirius Web is a framework from Obeo for building cloud graphical modelers for a dedicated DSL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ocp-publication&quot;&gt;OCP Publication&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCP Publication exposes models in a read-only mode for fast access from OSLC clients or web browsers. The first version of this product is ready to be deployed to our customers at the end of October.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sirius-web/OCP_Publication.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first use cases we developed allows us to reunite two of our chosen fields: Capella and model servers, it is Publication For Capella. Publication for Capella provides a tight integration between OSLC-compliant ALM tools (Polarion, Doors Next…) and the MBSE workbench Capella. It enables a fine grained traceability between your requirements and your system design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ocp-modeler&quot;&gt;OCP Modeler&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OCP Modeler is a unique technology to easily develop custom and state-of-the-art modeling tools to be deployed to the Cloud.
The Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler is a Sirius Web build extended with Enterprise features, to deploy on public, private clouds or on premise and including support and upgrade guarantees.
The Obeo Cloud Platform provides collaborative features: authentication, live collaboration, webhooks…&lt;/p&gt;

Our goal is to bring the spirit of Sirius into a new technological space : Sirius Web is the Cloud-based evolution of Sirius, 100% Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sirius-web/SiriusWebTimeline.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sirius Web engine combines the open source components EMF-JSON &amp;amp; Sirius Components. These components will be available under the Sirius project : &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org/sirius&quot;&gt;http://eclipse.org/sirius&lt;/a&gt;, with the source code on Github :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EMF-JSON&lt;/strong&gt; is a small library to serialize EMF models to JSON,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Sirius Components&lt;/strong&gt; repository provides backend and frontend components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Sirius Web&lt;/strong&gt; repository combines the open source Sirius components to provide a graphical modeler sample application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sirius-web/SiriusWebArchitecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-you-create-a-cloud-ready-modeler-based-on-sirius-web&quot;&gt;How do you create a cloud-ready modeler based on Sirius Web?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define your metamodel thanks to EMF.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Provide a Sirius configuration to specify the mapping between the different concepts of your DSL and how they should be represented graphically.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register the metamodel &amp;amp; the Sirius specification in the Sirius Web application.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build and launch the application!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/sirius-web/SiriusWebServer.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, you get a graphical modeler dedicated to your DSL rendered in your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To get more details about Sirius Web and how to run it for your own DSL, attend Obeo’s rocket liftoff.

The first open source project released by the SIRIUS-II Mission is: EMF-JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMF-JSON project will soon be part of the Eclipse Sirius project. It provides a JSON-based implementation of EMF resources which can be used as a drop-in replacement for the default XMI-based format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BbipffAatgY&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it is part of Sirius, this new EMF resource type can actually be used by any EMF-based application as it does not depend on the rest of the Sirius platform (neither the existing Sirius Desktop nor the upcoming Sirius Web).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liftoff on the SIRIUS-II mission to the Eclipse Foundation remains planned for an instantaneous launch window on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipsecon.org/2020/sessions/sirius-web-100-open-source-cloud-modeling-platform&quot;&gt;October 21 at 2:00 p.m CET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mélanie Bats</name></author><category term="planet" /><summary type="html">At Nantes Dev Force Station Launch Complex 42A, valves are open and code source is beginning to flow into Obeo’s rocket.

The first mission was a success with the adoption of Sirius Desktop, based on the Eclipse platform, by a large community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SIRIUS-II Mission aims to &lt;strong&gt;release Sirius Web&lt;/strong&gt;, the Cloud-based evolution of Sirius, 100% Open Source. This mission is also in charge of &lt;strong&gt;the launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.obeo.fr/en/products/obeo-cloud-platform&quot;&gt;Obeo Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt; (OCP)&lt;/strong&gt;, the solution offered by Obeo for deploying modeling tools to the web.
With Sirius Web, modeling tools developed with Sirius can be installed on a web server and are rendered in a browser. Our goal is to carry the spirit of Sirius into a new technological space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/unfzfe8f9NI&quot;&gt;Mamma Mia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 18th of June, I will have the pleasure of presenting the Obeo Cloud Platform, with my co-speaker &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sbegaudeau&quot;&gt;Stéphane Bégaudeau&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.siriuscon.org/&quot;&gt;SiriusCon Live 2020&lt;/a&gt;.
During SiriusCon 2020, we will not only demonstrate OCP, but also make a big announcement about its future. So, attend SiriusCon and be in for a huge surprise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After such a long time, it is great to be able to connect with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://eclipse.org/sirius&quot;&gt;Eclipse Sirius&lt;/a&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have to create a graphical modeling workbench for your own DSL, then you know how powerful Sirius is to help you design your own modeler based on EMF. In just a few hours, you get a modeling studio dedicated to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/gallery.html&quot;&gt;own domain&lt;/a&gt;.
The main issue faced by our customers arises when they need to distribute the bundle to their end users. A truly effective deployment is difficult to come by. Many struggle to either deploy or maintain their solution. And their team are feeling the pinch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To solve these challenges, I am excited to demonstrate the Obeo Cloud Platform (OCP), the Cloud-based solution developed by Obeo for deploying modeling tools to the web. With OCP Modeler, modeling tools developed with Sirius can be installed on a Cloud server and are rendered in a web browser. Our purpose is to carry the spirit of Sirius.
What our users typically love in Sirius is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the ability to define your modeling workbench in a configuration file,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;no code generation involved as everything is interpreted at runtime,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;flexible even for complex models.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we kept all those principles and now allow you to easily define workbenches running in the cloud.
We rebuilt the Sirius runtime from the ground up, for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been talking about it for a long time now! And we’re really proud to show that OCP is available and working today, so our talk will be purely a live demo: no slides (almost), no bullet points, not feature lists. Just us, showing the capabilities of this modeling environment!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/siriuscon2020/ocp.png&quot; alt=&quot;OCP Modeler&quot; title=&quot;OCP Modeler&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will give you as well an overview of the context, the roadmap and how OCP Modeler positions with Sirius.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring to ABBA’s words, take a chance on OCP!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Honey I’m still free &lt;br /&gt;
Take a chance on me &lt;br /&gt;
Gonna do my very best, baby can’t you see &lt;br /&gt;
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me“ &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/-crgQGdpZR0&quot;&gt;Take a chance on me&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, as a preparation, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/xFrGuyw1V8s&quot;&gt;you can dance, you can djibe&lt;/a&gt; and most importantly you have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/Register_SiriusCon2020&quot;&gt;register&lt;/a&gt;. And no, even if I am a big #ABBAFan the surprise is not that I will do my talk in a fancy glittering costume… neither Stéphane even if it could be very memorable :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost 2 years since I started operating as Obeo’s CTO, 2 years since I accepted the challenge to take the lead of our R&amp;amp;D. As part of this, almost 1 year ago I started to organize the development of our new generation modeling tool solution. And for the past 9 months my team has been busy working full time on this new product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you become &lt;del&gt;pregnant&lt;/del&gt; a product manager, you are basically a story trigger for everyone around you: people love to tell their failure-project and their stupid-leader story. It is scary to be at the place where you are the one who decides. It is even more frightening when you are at the point where you redesign your products with a completely different technological layer. This is where I was one year ago. At Obeo, we have been developing for years modeling workbenches based on the Eclipse Platform. Today our customers want more and asked us to modernize the modeling stack by making it cloud compliant. So how do we go from this statement to a first software release?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re a product manager or affiliate, you’re probably aware that the first nine months of a new software product are always a big adventure.
CTOs-to-be may have a lot of questions about what they can expect and the changes they’ll go through.
Do you know when to expect to feel your product move? When to look for a UI/UX designer or a continuous deployment pipeline? Customer interest on what you are developing? Is that the signs of preterm labor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1st-month---your-imagination-has-no-limit&quot;&gt;1st month - Your imagination has no limit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beginning of a new product is not easy. Where should we start?
Should we rely on the prototypes we already have? Should we built a completely new project? How will you build your team? Who will be in? When? What will be the first scenario that will be supported in your software? How should you be organized?
These are all the first questions you will come across.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I will remember from that first month is that at some point you have to take decision: that is why you are here, that’s your job, and that will remind you why there is a C in CTO. You have the power of choice.
There is not a unique good solution for everything. When every other person has a piece of advice for you, you start to understand that not everything works for everyone. I found what I believe works best for me. Of course, what works for me may not work for you: it depends on your company technological background but also on how you want to get your collaborators engaged as well. Each project, team and context is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the time to discuss this with others in your company, take the time to find what they need but also what are they dreaming about this new product. I developed my product vision for example by asking people to fill in a survey with questions such as in 1, 2, 5 years what is the final goal, the business needs, the users expectations, the success factor, etc. See the &lt;a href=&quot;/img/ocp-9month/ProductVision.png&quot;&gt;product vision template&lt;/a&gt; available on my github for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/img/ocp-9month/ProductVision.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/ocp-9month/ProductVision.png&quot; alt=&quot;Product Vision Template&quot; title=&quot;Product Vision&quot; class=&quot;center&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write a summary of all this.
And in the end, find your own voice in the ocean of opinions.
Build your team, define your first scenario, share with everyone what you decided and do not hesitate to fail! Your first organisation might not be the best one: try, learn, update, reorganize, try something else… You are not alone in this task, this is a collective effort. The entire team cares about its organization and discusses it regularly by making retrospectives, having a dedicated moment during regular meetings, defining process to improve their collaboration, selecting tools…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questional period you just went through, your team will go through the same. Which technical bricks will they rely on? Which part of our existing code will integrate this new project? Should we start by building the simplest scenario, this without taking into account the whole complexity of the end product you are trying to build? What should in the end be the software architecture?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important point, give some time to your team to discuss all those things. But ask them to produce something even during that period. In our case, we wrote documents (AsciiDoc rocks!) and decided to keep a trace of all our decisions. For that, we used ADR - Architectural Decision Record: it is like reading the pocket reference of your project. After several months of use, it has turned out to be really useful. It helps people who are working part time on the project to get what we decided and why and help remember why we took a given decision. It forces us to discuss and validate all the important decisions together.
You also need to stop this questioning period by just pushing your team to contribute &lt;em&gt;code&lt;/em&gt; and not just loosing them in the limbs of the imaginative product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mid-months---scared-believe-realize&quot;&gt;Mid months - Scared! Believe! Realize!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pregnancy, giving software birth and the first 3 months is such an emotional roller coaster with so many changes. As you move forward on your development journey, it is amazing to discover all the things your sweety-software can do before he’s born. We went through different themes during these months: Persistence, CRUD, Diagram, Properties views, Edition, Concurrence, Authentication…
Then everything is on track, you are organized as a team, code is being produced, your scenarios are more and more rich. And at some point, we realized we were actually growing life within us. It did not come right when we started the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt it in 3 specific moments —&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we chose the name - Obeo Cloud Platform,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When I had a first &lt;del&gt;ultrasound scan&lt;/del&gt; preview of the UI - fortunately we have a Design team to work with,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And when he kicked for the first time - I mean his first public live demo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_hx3lfRETI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also never forget our baby shower celebration at EclipseCon Europe! This was an amazing moment for us. We were so happy to present our new work to the Sirius community.
That day I was feeling the kicks in my belly.
As Steve Jobs puts it, “A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” That’s why we decided to give a preview of our new product even before it is polished, and why we launched a beta testing team. The idea is to give them a preview access and organize live remote testing sessions to grow the feedback river with real end-users. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Zgh3KMxtUU?amp=1&quot;&gt;Join us now and share your needs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;8-9th-months---you-are-almost-releasing&quot;&gt;8-9th months - You are (almost) releasing!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I do not even realise it is already the last months of pregnancy: we are getting closer and closer to our due date. I have this mixed feeling of excitement and nervousness and want our software product to come as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our product is getting ready for birth, and the whole Obeo family is preparing to welcome a new member. You are also invited to join us, stay tuned for the upcoming SiriusCon Live Q1 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of this year, on his first days, our software product will be tiny and little. It will know only a few things but will do them well. Next we will continue to feed him: baby bottles first and then we will go through the diversification phase introducing new kind of food.
My team will help him to grow, you, our users, our customers will be part of its education. We have many projects and plans, but we need you to turn true customers problems into product features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s important to stop and look back. It really made me appreciate and comprehend what an amazing experience I and my company went through ❤ and still are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you had a good read.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Mélanie Bats</name></author><category term="planet" /><summary type="html">TLDR; This is almost the story of my first CTO pregnancy experience, organizational stuff inside.</summary></entry></feed>
