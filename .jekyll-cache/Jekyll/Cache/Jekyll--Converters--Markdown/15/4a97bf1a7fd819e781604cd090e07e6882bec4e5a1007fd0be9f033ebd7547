I"4<p>At Nantes Dev Force Station Launch Complex 42A, valves are open and code source is beginning to flow into Obeoâ€™s rocket. The first open source project released by the SIRIUS-II Mission is: EMF-JSON.</p>

<p>The EMF-JSON project will soon be part of the Eclipse Sirius project. It provides a JSON-based implementation of EMF resources which can be used as a drop-in replacement for the default XMI-based format.</p>

<p>Although it is part of Sirius, this new EMF resource type can actually be used by any EMF-based application as it does not depend on the rest of the Sirius platform (neither the existing Sirius Desktop nor the upcoming Sirius Web).</p>

<p>Liftoff on the SIRIUS-II mission to the Eclipse Foundation remains planned for an instantaneous launch window on <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/2020/sessions/sirius-web-100-open-source-cloud-modeling-platform">October 21 at 2:00 p.m CET</a>.</p>
