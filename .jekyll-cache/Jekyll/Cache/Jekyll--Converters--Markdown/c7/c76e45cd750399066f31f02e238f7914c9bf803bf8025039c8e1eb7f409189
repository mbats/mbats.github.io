I"a<p>When I was a child one of my favorite game was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Bobble">Puzzle Bobble</a>, you may remember these two little dragons Bub and Bob. What I loved in this game : simple rules, easy to play and so very <a href="http://www.gamesgames.com/game/puzzle-bobble">addictive</a>.</p>

  <li>
    <p>The rules are really <strong>simple</strong> as it is the same as the ones existing for the other Sirius representations : define your properties in the .odesign file, it is <strong>dynamic</strong>, no code generation is involved.</p>
  </li>

    <p>It is very <strong>easy</strong> to use as it follow habits of Sirius Specifier : use expression to go through the model, then it is <strong>flexible</strong> even for complex Ecore models.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>And it is also greatly <strong>addictive</strong>! You will start by trying it on one of your Sirius based modeler and finally you will want to use it everywhere, even on non Sirius based editors.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
