I"ﬂ<p>At the end of last year Obeo open sourced a new project at the Eclipse Foundation : <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/sirius-web.html">Sirius Web</a>.</p>

<p>Sirius web is a framework to easily create and deploy modeling studios to the web.
Sirius web is evolving a lot and we would like to share with the community on what we are working on.
I am pleased to introduce a new regular series of videos: ‚ÄúBehind the scene of Sirius Web‚Äù__.
The goal is to show you in 1-2 minutes each month what we are working on in the Sirius Web project.
For this first session, I invited St√©phane Begaudeau, Software Architect of Sirius Web to present his work on the Diagramming component that aims at making this component easier to reuse in any web environment.</p>

<p>See you next month for another ‚ÄúBehind the scene‚Äù!</p>
