I"I<p>At the end of last year Obeo open sourced a new project at the Eclipse Foundation : <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/sirius-web.html">Sirius Web</a>.
Sirius web is a framework to easily create and deploy modeling studios to the web.</p>

<p>Sirius web is evolving a lot and we would like to share with the community these on-going enhancements.</p>

<p>I am pleased to introduce a new regular series of videos: <em>“Behind the scene of Sirius Web”</em>.
The goal is to show you in 1-2 minutes each month what we are working on in the Sirius Web project.
For this first session, I invited Stéphane Begaudeau, Software Architect of Sirius Web to present his work on the Diagramming Component that aims at making this component easier to reuse in any web environment.</p>

<p>Thanks to all our customers for helping in financing this development around Sirius Web.
See you next month for another “Behind the scene”!</p>
