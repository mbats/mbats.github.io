I"Å<p>Since my early childhood I have loved stories, listening to books read by my mum, then reading by myself comics or classical literature for school and now, as I dedicate not so much time to reading, mostly blog posts and news on the internet.
One of my favorite novels remains â€œAliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderlandâ€.
