I"í<p>I knowâ€¦ I am late for an happy new year but I am not for an Happy New <a href="https://docs.obeostudio.com/#_version_2022_01_0">2022.01.0</a>!
Iâ€™m in a dancing mood while Iâ€™m writing thisâ€¦ (and poor you) an idea comes to my mind: <em>â€œWhy not associate a song to each new feature?â€</em>
It could be <em>funny</em> and itâ€™ll result in a (terrible) soundtrack to play with this new version.
Follow me for a <em>musical</em> ride through the new Sirius Web and OCP features!</p>
