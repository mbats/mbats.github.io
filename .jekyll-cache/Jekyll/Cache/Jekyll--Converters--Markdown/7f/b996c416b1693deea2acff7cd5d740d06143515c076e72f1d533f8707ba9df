<p><i>â€œMamma mia, does it show again <br />
My my, just how much Iâ€™ve missed you?â€œ <br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/unfzfe8f9NI">Mamma Mia</a> <br /></i></p>

<p>On the 18th of June, I will have the pleasure of presenting the Obeo Cloud Platform, with my co-speaker <a href="https://twitter.com/sbegaudeau">StÃ©phane BÃ©gaudeau</a>, at <a href="https://www.siriuscon.org/">SiriusCon Live 2020</a>.
During SiriusCon 2020, we will not only demonstrate OCP, but also make a big announcement about its future. So, attend SiriusCon and be in for a huge surprise!</p>

<p>After such a long time, it is great to be able to connect with the <a href="http://eclipse.org/sirius">Eclipse Sirius</a> community.</p>

<p>If you have to create a graphical modeling workbench for your own DSL, then you know how powerful Sirius is to help you design your own modeler based on EMF. In just a few hours, you get a modeling studio dedicated to your <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/gallery.html">own domain</a>.
The main issue faced by our customers arises when they need to distribute the bundle to their end users. A truly effective deployment is difficult to come by. Many struggle to either deploy or maintain their solution. And their team are feeling the pinch.</p>

<p>To solve these challenges, I am excited to demonstrate the Obeo Cloud Platform (OCP), the Cloud-based solution developed by Obeo for deploying modeling tools to the web. With OCP Modeler, modeling tools developed with Sirius can be installed on a Cloud server and are rendered in a web browser. Our purpose is to carry the spirit of Sirius.
What our users typically love in Sirius is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to define your modeling workbench in a configuration file,</li>
  <li>no code generation involved as everything is interpreted at runtime,</li>
  <li>flexible even for complex models.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we kept all those principles and now allow you to easily define workbenches running in the cloud.
We rebuilt the Sirius runtime from the ground up, for the long haul.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been talking about it for a long time now! And weâ€™re really proud to show that OCP is available and working today, so our talk will be purely a live demo: no slides (almost), no bullet points, not feature lists. Just us, showing the capabilities of this modeling environment!</p>

<p>We will give you as well an overview of the context, the roadmap and how OCP Modeler positions with Sirius.</p>

<p>Referring to ABBAâ€™s words, take a chance on OCP!</p>

<p><i>â€œHoney Iâ€™m still free <br />
Take a chance on me <br />
Gonna do my very best, baby canâ€™t you see <br />
Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on meâ€œ <br />
<a href="https://youtu.be/-crgQGdpZR0">Take a chance on me</a> <br /></i></p>

<p>In the meantime, as a preparation, <a href="https://youtu.be/xFrGuyw1V8s">you can dance, you can djibe</a> and most importantly you have to <a href="https://bit.ly/Register_SiriusCon2020">register</a>. And no, even if I am a big #ABBAFan the surprise is not that I will do my talk in a fancy glittering costumeâ€¦ neither StÃ©phane even if it could be very memorable :).</p>
