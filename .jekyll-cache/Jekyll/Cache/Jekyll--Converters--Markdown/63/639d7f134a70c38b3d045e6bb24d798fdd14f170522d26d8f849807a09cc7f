<p>Do you ever feel that? This week I often dreamt I had the gift of ubiquityâ€¦ I could replicate myself and be in several places at once. It would be a really useful skill to participate to EclipseCon Europe. I am angry to not be able to see all the talks I would have liked to attend. Happily, as every year all the slides will be available on the EclipseCon website and most of the talks are recorded and will be available on the Eclipse Foundation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EclipseFdn">youtube channel</a>.</p>

<p>If you missed our talk yesterday, do not miss our <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/sirius-41-let-me-sirius-you">slides available online</a>.</p>
