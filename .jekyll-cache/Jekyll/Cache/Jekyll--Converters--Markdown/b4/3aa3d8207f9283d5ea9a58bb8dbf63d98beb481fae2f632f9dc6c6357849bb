I"~<p>A small post to announce that I will be speaking at <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/che/checonf18/index.html">CheConf18</a>, a one day conference dedicated to <a href="https://eclipse.org/che/">Eclipse Che</a> an extensible cloud development platform. I am really excited to participate to this event! I will co speak with Stevan Le Meur, Che maintainer from RedHat about <strong>Building Extensibility and Community for Che</strong>. During our session, youâ€™ll get a preview of the work we prototyped at <a href="https://www.obeo.fr/en">Obeo</a> to bring the modeling stack to the web and what class of tools one can envision.</p>
