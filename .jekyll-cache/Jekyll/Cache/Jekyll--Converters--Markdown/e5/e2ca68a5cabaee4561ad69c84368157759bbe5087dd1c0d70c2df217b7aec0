I"›<p>A small post to announce that I will be speaking at <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/che/checonf18/index.html">CheConf18</a>, a one day conference dedicated to <a href="https://eclipse.org/che/">Eclipse Che</a> an extensible cloud development platform. I am really excited to participate to this event! I will co speak with Stevan Le Meur, Che maintainer from RedHat about <strong>Building Extensibility and Community for Che</strong>. During our session, youâ€™ll get a preview of the work we prototyped at <a href="https://www.obeo.fr/en">Obeo</a> to bring the modeling stack to the web and what class of tools one can envision.</p>

<p>Perhaps you hadnâ€™t hear about CheConf so far ? No problem: itâ€™s not too late to participate. Indeed, thereâ€™s no need to negotiate with your boss, no need to book a flight and an hotel: this conference happens entirely online and is free!</p>

<p>You just need to <a href="https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=7kv7dn9ab&amp;p=oi&amp;m=1127869207900&amp;sit=dqf8xmplb&amp;f=ab2389bc-9888-4ff7-978e-f922c1210d52">subscribe</a> on the web site, and youâ€™ll be able to join the conference when you want.
Have a look at the great <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/che/checonf18/sessions.html">schedule</a>.
