<p>It was again a great conference, with inspiring talks and excellent discussions with different members of the Eclipse community. These moments with our community are motivating us to prepare the future of <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/sirius">Eclipse Sirius</a>.</p>

<p>So whatâ€™s next? What would we cook for you in Eclipse Oxygen?</p>

<p>As we already said in our talk, we are already preparing the future with Sirius 4.1 when we introduce the <em>DRepresentationDescriptor</em>. This internal change has no impact on normal users: it was made as a first step to <strong>prepare for better scalability</strong> down the road. For specifiers and developers who wrote code that depends on the internal organisation of the *.aird files, you may need to adapt your code.</p>

<p>To learn more about the Sirius roadmap, be sure to not missed Cedricâ€™s talk at <a href="http://www.siriuscon.org/">SiriusCon</a>.</p>

<p>I will also give a talk with StÃ©phane specifically about the Properties view feature, we will detail whatâ€™s possible with this new feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Let Sirius automatically create default properties views for your designer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a simple properties view description and customize it as you do for other types of representations thanks to the following widgets: label, text, text area, checkbox, radio, list, reference</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the new EMF.Edit customizations provided by Sirius</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discover the power of the dynamic mappings to automatically create the properties view fields for the different types of elements used in your metamodels</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Understand how to provide filters and validation programmatically</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn how to contribute some custom widgets</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And much more!</p>

<p>Do not look for excuses, SiriusCon is where you have to be if you are interested in graphical modeling: easy to come as it will be held in Paris near the tour Eiffel, itâ€™s a one day event, and itâ€™s free. The <a href="http://www.siriuscon.org/#program">program</a> promises to be interesting with talks about case studies on the morning, technical sessions by the afternoon and a clinic all the day.</p>

<p>I am counting on you <a href="http://www.siriuscon.org/register.php">being there</a> on November 15th and I hope to see you soon at SiriusCon!</p>
