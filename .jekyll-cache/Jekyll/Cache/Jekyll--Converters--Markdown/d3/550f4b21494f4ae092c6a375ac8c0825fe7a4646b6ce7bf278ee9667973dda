<p>You already discovered with the <a href="http://melb.enix.org/sirius/sirius-4-0-stability-and-performance">previous posts</a> that Sirius is more and more powerful. Sirius 4.0 offers more and more possibilities to our advanced users thanks to super powered APIs.</p>

<p><strong>API to control the tab-bar</strong>

The top area of all Sirius diagram editors is filled with the tab-bar, which provides access to many operations on diagrams and their elements. From now on, Sirius provides an API to get complete control of how the tab-bar is filled: which elements to put (Sirius standard ones or custom ones) and in which order.

<p><strong>Better integration with EMF Edit</strong>

For the specifier, Sirius 4.0 comes with a better integration with EMF Edit. While it is only the beginning, Sirius is now contributing the EditingDomainServices service class, which can be referenced from any VSM. This class provides a large set of methods giving access to many useful features of the EMF Edit framework. It provides general editing domain related services and contributes all types of Item Providers, in a way that is directly accessible as service invocations from interpreted expressions. It also offers item property related services. A series of service methods can be used to invoke the standard EMF Commands available from and ItemProviderAdapterâ€™s various createXXXCommand() methods. Note that contrary to the createXXXCommand() methods which simply returns a Command instance, the service methods exposed in this class will directly execute the command on the editing domains CommandStack.
