<p><em>Disclaimer: First, you should know that I am a girl born in the 80’s and so I grew up watching (and watching and re-watching…) Disney’s movies, and I am still used to watch them when new ones are released. So I am sorry for you: no doubt, at the end of this article you will have many annoying songs running in your head. 
But all those girls made what I am today and it is only justice to them to ear once more time what they have to say ;)</em></p>

<p>Seven years ago I joined the <a href="https://www.obeo.fr/">Obeo</a> company. At that time, it was a small frenchies’ company making open source modeling tools. I was a free software activist but at that point even though I was using lots of free software, I never had the bravery to contribute by my own on my free time. When I was thinking about Obeo, I just wanted to be <a href="https://youtu.be/SXKlJuO07eM">part of that world</a>.</p>

<p>At some point as my technical skills could fit their needs, I decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/L0MK7qz13bU">let it go</a> and send them my resume.</p>

<p>And know what? They recruited me! It was both amazing and scary. It was like a dazzling place, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kl4hJ4j48s">whole new world</a> to discover.</p>

<p>Year after year, I got the chance to work and learn from the talented Obeo’s experts about Eclipse &amp; modeling stuff. They shared their high technical skills &amp; knowledge with me and I loved this atmosphere of constant research of improvements and innovations. I learned so much! 
Working at Obeo opened me the doors of the open source community through the Eclipse community. I had the opportunity to participate to many conferences, giving talks and sharing my knowledge in turn. I could not say <a href="https://youtu.be/cPAbx5kgCJo">how far I would go</a> but I was on the open source community road…</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/wbVlGESh9Mc">I’ve got a dream</a>… Be part of the open source world! Day after day it became true. First, two years ago I became committer on the Eclipse <a href="https://eclipse.org/sirius/">Sirius</a> &amp; <a href="https://eclipse.org/eef/">EEF</a> projects, and this year, since one month, I am the <a href="https://wiki.eclipse.org/Planning_Council">Eclipse Planning Council</a> chair.
I am really proud of working on free software and particularly on the Sirius technology. I feel even happier when this framework is used to create other impressive open source tools such as <a href="https://www.polarsys.org/capella/">Capella</a>, a graphical modeler for Model Based System Engineering.</p>

<p>A few months ago, Obeo’s management announced me that we will open a new subsidiary in Vancouver, Canada! This was an awesome news. Our current CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/slacrampe">Stéphane Lacrampe</a> would move overseas to manage the new entity. This will allow us to be physically present on the new continent, making our international expansion easier and faster. <a href="https://twitter.com/bruncedric">Cédric Brun</a> our CTO will replace Stéphane as CEO.
And they offered me to become the new Obeo’s CTO. I am at the same time proud and really excited by the many challenges this new position brings! I will do my best!</p>

<p>So being Obeo’s CTO is my new game from now. This means for me lots of fun ahead, this is my new spoonful of sugar!</p>

<p><i>“In every job that must be done <br />
There is an element of fun <br />
You find the fun and snap! <br />
The job’s a game <br />
And every task you undertake <br />
Becomes a piece of cake“ <br />
Mary Poppins <br /></i></p>

<p>Thanks open source community, Eclipse Foundation and Obeo for giving me this opportunity!</p>
