<p>Wednesday will be a huge day for <a href="https://www.obeo.fr/en/">Obeo</a> at <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016">EclipseCon Europe 2016</a>. You will find <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/program/sessions/accepted?keys=sirius&amp;field_experience_value=All&amp;field_session_type_tid=All">several talks about Eclipse Sirius</a> in the program, and one thing for you, you have to attend our talk about <a href="https://www.eclipsecon.org/europe2016/session/sirius-41-let-me-sirius-you">Sirius 4.1: Let Me Sirius That For You!</a></p>

<p>As usual when I have to give a talk I am a little frightened but in fact I love this feeling which pushes me to do my best :)</p>

<p>Our slides are ready, our demo is exciting, now we just need you at Theater Stage - Wednesday, October 26, 2016 - 16:00.</p>
