I"É<p>Atop the Sirius-II Missionâ€™s rocket is the Obeo Cloud Platform (OCP), with two flavors â€“ OCP Modeler and OCP Publication â€“ safely strapped inside.
The Obeo Cloud Platform is built as an open-core product relying on the open source Eclipse Sirius project (EPL 2.0 licence) and more precisely on the Sirius Web component. As I explained in my previous post, Sirius Web is a framework from Obeo for building cloud graphical modelers for a dedicated DSL.</p>

<h2 id="ocp-publication">OCP Publication</h2>

<p>OCP Publication exposes models in a read-only mode for fast access from OSLC clients or web browsers. The first version of this product is ready to be deployed to our customers at the end of October.</p>

<p>One of the first use cases we developed allows us to reunite two of our chosen fields: Capella and model servers, it is Publication For Capella. Publication for Capella provides a tight integration between OSLC-compliant ALM tools (Polarion, Doors Nextâ€¦) and the MBSE workbench Capella. It enables a fine grained traceability between your requirements and your system design.</p>

<h2 id="ocp-modeler">OCP Modeler</h2>

<p>OCP Modeler is a unique technology to easily develop custom and state-of-the-art modeling tools to be deployed to the Cloud.
The Obeo Cloud Platform Modeler is a Sirius Web build extended with Enterprise features, to deploy on public, private clouds or on premise and including support and upgrade guarantees.
The Obeo Cloud Platform provides collaborative features: authentication, live collaboration, webhooksâ€¦</p>
