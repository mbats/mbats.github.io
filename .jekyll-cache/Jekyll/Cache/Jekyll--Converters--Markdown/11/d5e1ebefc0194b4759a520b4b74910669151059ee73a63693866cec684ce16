I"Ð<p>Atop the Sirius-II Missionâ€™s rocket is the Obeo Cloud Platform (OCP), with two flavors â€“ OCP Modeler and OCP Publication â€“ safely strapped inside.
The Obeo Cloud Platform is built as an open-core product relying on the open source Eclipse Sirius project (EPL 2.0 licence) and more precisely on the Sirius Web component. As I explained in my previous post, Sirius Web is a framework from Obeo for building cloud graphical modelers for a dedicated DSL.</p>
